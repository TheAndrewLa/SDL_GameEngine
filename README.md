# SDL_GameEngine
This is my one night project - a prototype of game engine which was written with SDL libraries. 

I used SDL2 for main functions, SDL_Mixer for sound output and SDL_TTF for fonts.

I think I should create some more systems (like resource, input, physics) and create completed game with my engine
